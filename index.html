<h1>Breach and Attack Simulation Tools</h1>
A <p>Breach and Attack Simulation Tool</p> is a security testing software that enables simulating realistic
attacks with an automation-oriented approach. The simulation must be standardized, reproducible
and allow for continuous testing. The tool aims to examine the system's security and produce results
accordingly, outlining vulnerabilities and suggesting mitigations.
</br></br>
During the last 10 years a great number of tools have been implemented in order to improve this process reducing the time required,
broadening the coverage of attacks and reducing the cost of having a red team.
The current panorama of technologies related to this field is complex: there are different softwares that use diverse terminologies and have very different capabilities and features.
