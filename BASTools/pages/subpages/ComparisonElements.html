    As explained in 'Framework Design', this final section of the 'Tool Analysis Framework' aims to enumerate the elements that can be used
     to directly compare two solutions. Unlike the previous features, these elements may be difficult to evaluate
      objectively, and developing a precise metric can be challenging in
       some cases. Finally, as noted in the introduction of this chapter,
        it is important to remember that this section focuses on highlighting 
        the features that are valuable to consider when comparing two BAS software,
         omitting the general comparison elements applicable to software in general.
