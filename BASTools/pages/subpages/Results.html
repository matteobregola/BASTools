    The “Results” section comprehends the features describing which type of results regarding 
    the simulations are presented and how. An effective tool grants a clear understanding to the 
    user about how the system responded to the simulation, which targets are more vulnerable and 
    which activities represent the highest risk for the system. It is important to provide the
     user with as much information as possible but also to permit him to filter or visualize only 
     the ones that he considers useful[1].  Another fundamental aspect of BAS that is analysed in 
     this section is providing the user with suggestions on how to fix its vulnerabilities.
