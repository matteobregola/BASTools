    <h1>Technology Explanation</h1>

Breach and attack simulation tools are software used for offensive security.
These kinds of technologies are used in order to simulate an attack to the infrastructure in order
to test if something is vulnerable, what types of attack are more plausable and which can create more damage.

</br></br>
In order to reach this objective they have different ways to interact with the system, the majority of them
require to create a command & control channel between the system that is running the attacker and the one that is "reciving" the attack.
There are other possibilities to this approach, from the simpler one that require to launch the tests directly
from the endpoints, to SaaS solutions. 
</br></br>

<h1>Why?</h1>
It is a objective fact that the <a href="ï‚§	https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191004005232/en/1.68-Billion-Automated-Breach-Attack-Simulation-Markets">number</a>,
 complexity and economic damage of cyberattacks is increasing.
Therefore it is required to shift the paradigm from "avoiding a breach" to "analyse possible breaches" and 
test what the attackers can do against our defences. Therefore we don't need anymore only a blue team but also a red one.
But even with this perspective, the traditional way to perform red teaming engagment is slow, difficulto to replicate or automated and therefore very costly. 
For these reasos BAS tools are a great addition. To be more coincise we could highlight these point:
<ul>
    <li>
        Change security approach to adapt to new threats,
    </li>
    <li>
        Improve red teams' efficency, cost, performance,
    </li>
    <li>
        Have objective results about your system security
    </li>
    <li>
        Test performance of acquired Security Solutions
    </li>
    <li>
        High ROI
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>Who?</h1>
As previously mentioned, the technology has been developed for red teams users and should be 
used as a purple team exercise to share the knowledge. However, the paradigm is shifting to facilitate 
the work and simplify the operations in order to make these software accessible to a trained IT team or to be
completely hosted and performed by third party companies.
