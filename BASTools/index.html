Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) is a security technology within the field called "offensive security".
The main objective of BAS is to enhance the security of the infastructure by performing simulations against the system's defenses
from the perspective of an attacker. These operations are performed by red team experts.
</br></br>
During the last 10 years a great number of tools have been implemented in order to improve this process reducing the time required,
broadening the coverage of attacks and reducing the cost of having a red team.
The current panorama of technologies related to this field is complex: there are different softwares that use diverse terminologies and have very different capabilities and features.
</br></br>
Therefore the purpose of this work is double: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Provide a definition of BAS Tools, including its use cases, the advantages of these software and a general explanation
        of their usage;
    </li>
    <li> 
        Provide a framework that can be used to analyse a tool in order to determine what are its capabilities and 
        compare it with otherss.
    </li>
</ul>
