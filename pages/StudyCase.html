The framework has been tested with MITRE Caldera. The <p>"Overall Score"</p> obtained by evaluating the mean
over all the categories of the framework is <p>47%</p>.

From the results we can see that the tool has a performance that is very different based on 
the category (<p class="it">note also the table below</p>), for example it has a very good <a href="{{'/framework/organization' | relative_url }}">"Organization"</a> result (<p>90%</p>), this is due to 
the fact that tool is based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework that is very well structured. It is also
important to point out that the analysis framework itself has been developed by studying MITRE ATT&CK, therefore
this could be a biased result. 
</br></br>
It has a notable performace also for the <a href="{{'/framework/attack' | relative_url }}">"Attack"</a> and <a href="{{'/framework/simulation' | relative_url }}">"Simulation"</a> categories (<p>69%</p> and <p>71%</p>), reflecting the good capabilities
of the software to help red team simulations.
</br></br>
On the other hand it has bad results on the <a href="{{'/framework/results' | relative_url }}">"Results"</a> and <a href="{{'/framework/informationfiltering' | relative_url }}">"Information and Filtering"</a> categories (respectively <p>28%</p>, <p>31%</p>).
