description: Case study of the framework to understand, analyse and compare Breach and Attack Simulation Tools (BAS Tools)
---  
<h1>MITRE CALDERA® Case Study</h1>  
We accomplished a case study of our framework leveraging MITRE CALDERA®.This analysis has the objective of assessing the effectivness of the framework and the tool.

<div class="charts">
    <canvas id="Caldera-Results-area"></canvas>
</div>
<script>
    Chart.defaults.backgroundColor = '#ffff';
    Chart.defaults.borderColor = 'rgba(255,255,255,0.2)';
    Chart.defaults.color = '#ffff';
    new Chart("Caldera-Results-area", {
        type: "radar",
        data: {
            labels: [
                'Architecture',
                'Organization',
                'Attack',
                'Results',
                'Information Filtering',
                'Simulation',
                'Environment',
                'Other'
            ],
            datasets: get_radar_data(),
        },
        options: {
            scales: {
                r: {
                    min: 0,
                    max: 100,
                    beginAtZero: true,
                    ticks: {
                        stepSize: 10,
                        backdropColor: 'transparent',
                    },
                }
            },
        },
    });
</script>

</br>

The data indicates that the tool's performance differs greatly based on the category. It has an
excellent result (<p>90%</p>) in the <a href="{{'/framework/organization' | relative_url }}">"Organization"</a> category, although this outcome is partially biased since
this category was developed taking as reference MITRE ATT&CK, and Caldera leverages it too. The
tool performs well in the Attack and Simulation categories (<p>69%</p> and <p>71%</p>), reflecting the software's satisfactory 
capabilities in helping red team operations. More than half of the features presented
in <a href="{{'/framework/architecture' | relative_url }}">"Architecture"</a> are available, whereas the categories <a href="{{'/framework/other' | relative_url }}">"Other"</a> and <a href="{{'/framework/environment' | relative_url }}">"Enviroment"</a> reveal results slightly
below the passing mark.
</br>
Finally, the tool has a poor score on <a href="{{'/framework/results' | relative_url }}">"Results"</a> and <a href="{{'/framework/informationfiltering' | relative_url }}">"Information and Filtering"</a> categories (respectively <p>28%</p>, <p>31%</p>). The unsatisfactory performance on the <a href="{{'/framework/results' | relative_url }}">"Results"</a> category was
expected; this solution was born to help the red team's operations and is considered an Adversary
Emulation Platform. For these reasons, its primary focus lies on the attack, while the support offered
in analyzing the results and providing mitigations lags behind commercial BAS solutions. The sub-
optimal outcome in the Information and Filtering category is because the tool's filtering is based on
MITRE ATT&CK's, which permits filtering based on tactic, technique and platform but leaves out
other valuable details like the APT correlation or the last update time. Furthermore, the reports are
available in PDF, JSON, and CSV formats, but there are limited capabilities for analysing the results
directly from the platform.
</br></br>
Overall, the tool offered 63 of the 145 analysed features, which can be considered a decedent result
considering the intrinsic limitations of applying a Framework designed for BAS solutions to an Ad-
versary Emulation software. The tool’s performance was notably affected by lower evaluations in
categories that distinguish AE Tools from BAS Tools, which significantly impacted the final results.
