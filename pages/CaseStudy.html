description: Case study of the framework to understand, analyse and compare Breach and Attack Simulation Tools (BAS Tools)
---  
<h1>MITRE CALDERA® Case Study</h1>  
The framework has been tested with MITRE CALDERA®. The <p>"Overall Score"</p> obtained by evaluating the mean
over all the categories of the framework is <p>43%</p>.

<div class="charts">
    <canvas id="Caldera-Results-area"></canvas>
</div>
<script>
    Chart.defaults.backgroundColor = '#ffff';
    Chart.defaults.borderColor = 'rgba(255,255,255,0.2)';
    Chart.defaults.color = '#ffff';
    new Chart("Caldera-Results-area", {
        type: "radar",
        data: {
            labels: [
                'Architecture',
                'Organization',
                'Attack',
                'Results',
                'Information Filtering',
                'Simulation',
                'Environment',
                'Other'
            ],
            datasets: get_radar_data(),
        },
        options: {
            scales: {
                r: {
                    min: 0,
                    max: 100,
                    beginAtZero: true,
                    ticks: {
                        stepSize: 10,
                        backdropColor: 'transparent',
                    },
                }
            },
        },
    });
</script>

From the results we can see that the tool has a performance that is very different based on 
the category (<p class="it">note also the table below</p>), for example it has a very good <a href="{{'/framework/organization' | relative_url }}">"Organization"</a> result (<p>90%</p>), this is due to 
the fact that tool is based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework that is very well structured. It is also
important to point out that the analysis framework itself has been developed by studying MITRE ATT&CK, therefore
this could be a biased result. 
</br></br>
It has a notable performace also for the <a href="{{'/framework/attack' | relative_url }}">"Attack"</a> and <a href="{{'/framework/simulation' | relative_url }}">"Simulation"</a> categories (<p>69%</p> and <p>71%</p>), reflecting the good capabilities
of the software to help red team simulations.
</br></br>
On the other hand it has insufficient performance on the <a href="{{'/framework/results' | relative_url }}">"Results"</a> and <a href="{{'/framework/informationfiltering' | relative_url }}">"Information and Filtering"</a> categories (respectively <p>28%</p>, <p>31%</p>).
