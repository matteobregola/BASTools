  <div class="info">
    Information and Filtering is a subcategory of both Attack and Results categories. As described in
    section 3.2, the essence of BAS is to simulate the attacker's actions. To enhance the tool's capabilities,
    it is fundamental to provide the users with information about these actions, permitting operators to have a broader view of the simulation.
     In the Organization category, it has been presented the
    difference between Action and Operation; in this section, the term Activity will be used to comprehend
    both to simplify the descriptions.
    </br>
    The activity's information can be used principally in three different ways:
    <ul>
      <li>To give more detail of the activity to the user,</li>
      <li>To filter activities before performing an attack simulations,</li>
      <li>To filter the simulation report to analyze the results in further detail.</li>
    </ul>
    Given these use cases, the framework permits, in this section, to check not only if the tool provides
    that specific information but also if it can be used to filter the activities or to sort the results. To
    perform this test, when it makes sense8, the features are virtually arranged in groups of three:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The first one, with reference starting with “X”, describes what is the specific information it's
        referring to.
      </li>
      <li>
        The second one, with reference starting with “Y”, checks if it's possible to filter between all
        the activities offered by the tool based on the information described in the “X” feature and tests
        if this subset can be used to run a simulation. In particular, the “Activities Filtering” feature
        in the Organization section is used to verify if the tool offers this filtering capability.
      </li>
      <li>
        The third one, with reference starting with “Z”, checks if it's possible to analyse the simulation
        results by filtering them based on the information described in “X” or to generate a report
        including only the activities that match that specific “X” feature.
        In particular, two features in the Results section respectively “Analytics” and “Result Filtering”
        are used to verify if and how the tool offers this filtering capability.
      </li>
    </ul>
    The following example illustrates this reasoning:
    <ul>
      <li>
        “Update” [X11] -> The tool reports the date of the last activity's update,
      </li>
      <li>
        “Update Filtering” [Y11] -> The tool permits filtering among all possible
        activities only the ones updated in a certain range of time.
      </li>
      <li>
        "Update Results” [Z11] -> The tool permits filtering the simulation results based on the activities'
        last update to analyse the results only of that particular range.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="image-container">

    </div>

    The picture above shows the logical connection between the information and how it can be used in order to
    filter activities before launching a simulation or to sort out the results.
