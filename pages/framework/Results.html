  This section outlines the features that describe the type of simulation results presented and how
  they are displayed. An effective tool offers a clear understanding of how the system responds to the
  simulation, which targets are more vulnerable and which activities represent the highest risk for the
  system. It is important to provide as much information as possible and permit the user to filter and
  visualize only the ones that he considers useful. Another key aspect of BAS analyzed in this section
  is whether the tool offers users suggestions on how to fix vulnerabilities
