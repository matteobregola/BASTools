  The “Results” section comprehends the features describing which type of results regarding
  the simulations are presented and how. An effective tool grants a clear understanding to the
  user about how the system responded to the simulation, which targets are more vulnerable and
  which activities represent the highest risk for the system. It is important to provide the
  user with as much information as possible but also to permit him to filter or visualize only
  the ones that he considers useful[1]. Another fundamental aspect of BAS that is analysed in
  this section is providing the user with suggestions on how to fix its vulnerabilities.
