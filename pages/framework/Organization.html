  The Breach and Attack Simulation tools that are present on the market offer different
  simulation capabilities that can be distinguished not only by their objectives but also by h
  ow they are structured. Many solutions subdivide the general concept of simulation into smaller
  elements that can be grouped or chained to perform a simulation.
  There are different possibilities for performing this subdivision, this framework provides a
  two-element subdivision that is considered to be the most suitable option for a comparison
  with the other tools [1]. These elements are named “Ability” and “Operation”. An “Ability” has
  a basic objective achievable by running a few commands, multiple abilities can be grouped
  into an “Operation” to reach a more complex goal [2]. A simulation involves one or many operations.
  Therefore the features of this section permit the reader to verify if the tool offers a logical
  structure similar to this, how much is it customisable and what are the benefits of having multiple fine-grain
  elements rather than a whole “simulation” object. It is important to consider it may not be
  possible to have a straightforward comparison of these features with the ones in the BAS
  solutions due to.
