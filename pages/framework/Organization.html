  The Breach and Attack Simulation Tools available on the market offer different simulation capabilities
  that can be distinguished not only by their objectives but also by how they are structured. Many solu-
  tions subdivide the general simulation concept into smaller elements that can be grouped or chained to
  perform a simulation. There are different possibilities for performing this subdivision; this framework
  provides a two-element subdivision compatible with the solutions adopted by the various tools. These
  two elements are named Ability and Operation. An Ability has a basic and straightforward objective,
  achievable by running a few commands; multiple abilities can be grouped into an Operation to reach
  a more complex goal. A Simulation involves one or many operations. Therefore, the features of this
  section permit the reader to verify if the tool offers a logical structure similar to this, how much it is
  customizable, and the benefits of having multiple fine-grain elements rather than a whole “simulation
  object”. It is essential to consider that it may not be possible to directly compare these features with
  the ones in BAS solutions due to a different simulation subdivision, and an adjustment may be needed.
