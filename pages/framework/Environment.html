  This section aims to analyze whether and how the tool is integrated into the user’s environment and
  adapted to its needs. A BAS solution is typically used by an organization’s IT or cybersecurity team.
  Therefore, to streamline their work, the tool should be flexible not only from a technical standpoint,
  enabling interaction with other elements, but also from an organizational perspective, allowing use by
  different individuals with various roles.
