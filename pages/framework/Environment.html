  This section aims to analyse whether and how the tool is integrated into the user's environment and adapted
  for its needs. A BAS solution is typically used by the IT or cybersecurity team of an organization.
  Therefore, to streamline their work, the tool should be flexible not only from a technical standpoint,
  enabling interaction with other elements, but also from an organizational perspective, allowing use by
  different individuals with various roles.
