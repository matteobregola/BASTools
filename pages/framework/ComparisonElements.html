  As explained in 'Framework Design', this final section of the 'Tool Analysis Framework' aims to enumerate the elements
  that can be used
  to directly compare two solutions. Unlike the previous features, these elements may be difficult to evaluate
  objectively, and developing a precise metric can be challenging in
  some cases. Finally, as noted in the introduction of this chapter,
  it is important to remember that this section focuses on highlighting
  the features that are valuable to consider when comparing two BAS software,
  omitting the general comparison elements applicable to software in general.
