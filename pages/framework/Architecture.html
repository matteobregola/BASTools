  The Architecture category comprehends features describing the software technical components and
  the deployment methodology. This section is crucial for deciding whether a specific solution suits a
  particular use case. As previously mentioned, it is not generally recommended to exclusively verify
  how many features a tool offers but rather to study which ones align with the user's needs. This
  reasoning is particularly relevant to the features in this section. For instance, a tool that offers both
  software as a service and on-premise solutions in a single package can be unnecessarily costly if the
  buyer's system is not compatible with cloud environments.
