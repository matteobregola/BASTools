  The “Architecture” section comprehends the features describing the tool software technical
  components and the deployment. This section is crucial in deciding whether a specific solution
  is suitable for a particular use case. As said in the first note is not in general recommended
  to exclusively verify how many of the features a tool offers but rather study which of them are
  aligned with your needs, and this is particularly true for the features in this section.
  For instance, a tool that offers with an unique solution both the software as a service
  and on-premise can be unnecessarily more costly if the buyer system it's not compatible
  with cloud environments.
