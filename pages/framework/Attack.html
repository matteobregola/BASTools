  The features in this section aim to analyse what are the general attack capabilities of the
  software. This list comprehend also last four features (C9 to C13) that are related more to
  the “configuration” of the attack, meaning the selection of targets, activities and their
  order. In particular the features “Activity Filtering” and “Activities Combined Filtering”
  are the attributes used to verify if the tool permits to filter the activities based on the
  elements described in the “Information and Filtering” subsection.
