  The features in this section aim to analyze the software's general attack capabilities. This list comprises
  thirteen features; five of them (C9 to C13) are related to the attack “configuration”, meaning the
  selection of targets, activities, and their order. In particular, the features Activity Filtering and
  Activities Combined Filtering are the attributes used to verify if the tool permits the filtering of
  activities based on the elements described in the Information and Filtering subsection.
