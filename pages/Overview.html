    <h1>Framework Overview</h1>
    As explained in the framework desing section, there are 8 categories, 1 sub-category for a total of
    164 features. The categories (and sub) are:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="{{'/framework/architecture' | relative_url }}">Architecture</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{'/framework/organization' | relative_url }}">Organization</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{'/framework/attack' | relative_url }}">Attack</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{'/framework/results' | relative_url }}">Results</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{'/framework/informationfiltering' | relative_url }}">Information Filtering</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{'/framework/simulation' | relative_url }}">Simulation</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{'/framework/environment' | relative_url }}">Environment</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{'/framework/other' | relative_url }}">Other</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{'/framework/comparisonelements' | relative_url }}">Comparison Elements</a></li>

    </ul>
    </br></br>
    The framework names the features in a “positive” and non-exclusive way, meaning that a tool could (theoretically) have all the features (all “✓”).
    Nevertheless, it is not intended to apply this study as a checklist but to analyze all the possible elements of BAS tools
    and choose what subset of them are aligned with the desired use case. Developing a tool that has all the features is 
    probably not possible but more importantly, it would be performance inefficient, economically unsustainable and
    too complex to use. Another noteworthy consideration is that the features are delineated and enumerated from a “client” 
    standpoint, highlighting the functionalities provided to the user. For this reason, when categorizing under 
    the architecture section, the analysis of the pros and cons of various solutions pertains not to the benefits for
    the tool developers but to those for the tool purchaser.
