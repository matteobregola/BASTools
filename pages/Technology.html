    <h1>Technology Explanation</h1>

    A <p>Breach and Attack Simulation Tool</p> is a security testing software that enables simulating realistic
    attacks with an automation-oriented approach. The simulation must be standardized, reproducible
    and allow for continuous testing. The tool aims to examine the system's security and produce results
    accordingly, outlining vulnerabilities and suggesting mitigations.

<h2>General Interaction</h2>
BAS Tools have different ways to interact with the system, the majority of them adopt an agent-based approach which leverages the structure represented in the image below.

  </div>
 The agent-based architecture presents three main components:
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Testers</p>: personnel involved in the simulation interacting with the BAS Tool. The interaction between 
        the tester and the tool depends on the specific functionalities of the tool, which usually offers a 
        graphical user interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>BAS Tools</p>: is the centre of command of all the operations, typically installed directly on devices
        accessible to testers. The software can communicate with agents and vice-versa by leveraging a
        command and control channel. There are several ways in which this connection is established,
        for example, Caldera [16] requires running a payload on the agent system while other solutions
        require installing a software on the targets.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Agents</p> the various elements of the testers' infrastructure that will be the target of the simulation. 
        The type of agents supported depends on the specific solution, and they can be endpoints, 
        personal devices, servers, databases and many more.
    </li>
</ul>
After having finished the pre-engagment phase the tester selects the simulation to perform and the targets. 
The tool has established a command and control channel between the testing machines and the tested machine,
 this channel is used to send and execute the attack payloads and then to retrieve the attack output and the
  system response as the security logs. This data is evaluated to assess the security posture and the discovered vulnerabilities.

<h2>Advantages of BAS Tools</h2>
It is objective that the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191004005232/en/1.68-Billion-Automated-Breach-Attack-Simulation-Markets">amount</a>,
 complexity and economic damage of cyberattacks is increasing.
 Therefore, it is essential to shift the paradigm from "avoiding a breach" to "analyzing possible breaches" and testing what
  attackers can do against our defenses. This shift necessitates the inclusion of both blue teams 
  and red teams in our security strategy.
 However, traditional red teaming engagements are often slow, difficult to replicate or automate, 
 and consequently very costly. Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) Tools address these challenges effectively. To summarize, the key benefits of BAS Tools are:
<ul>
    <li>
        Change security approach to adapt to new threats,
    </li>
    <li>
        Improve red teams' efficency, cost, performance,
    </li>
    <li>
        Generate objective results about your system's security
    </li>
    <li>
        Test performance of acquired security solutions,
    </li>
    <li>
        High ROI
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations of BAS Tools</h2>
The technology is relatively new and faces challenges both due to its novelty and inherent limitations. 
The principal limitations of the currently available Breach and Attack Simulation Tools are:
<ul>
    <li>
        Scarce accessibility,
    </li>
    <li>
        Improvable automation capabilities,
    </li>
    <li>
        Partial effectivness of simulations,
    </li>
    <li>
        Leverage of pre-existing exploits to discover vulnerabilities,
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Interested Audience</h2>
The technology has been developed to assess red teams and should be 
imployed in a purple perspective to share the knowledge. BAS Tools are shifting their approach to facilitate 
the work and simplify the operations; this has the objective to make these software accessible to a trained IT team or to be
completely hosted and performed by third party companies.
