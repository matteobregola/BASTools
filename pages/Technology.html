    <h1>Technology Explanation</h1>

    A <p>Breach and Attack Simulation Tool</p> is a security testing software that enables simulating realistic
    attacks with an automation-oriented approach. The simulation must be standardized, reproducible
    and allow for continuous testing. The tool aims to examine the system's security and produce results
    accordingly, outlining vulnerabilities and suggesting mitigations.
</br></br>
In order to reach this objective BAS Tools have different ways to interact with the system, the majority of them
establish create a command & control channel between the system that is orhcestrating the attack operations and the "target" endpoints.
There are other possibilities to this approach, from the simpler one that requires to launch the tests directly
from the endpoints, to SaaS solutions. 
</br></br>

<h2>Why?</h2>
It is objective that the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191004005232/en/1.68-Billion-Automated-Breach-Attack-Simulation-Markets">amount</a>,
 complexity and economic damage of cyberattacks is increasing.
 Therefore, it is essential to shift the paradigm from "avoiding a breach" to "analyzing possible breaches" and testing what
  attackers can do against our defenses. This shift necessitates the inclusion of both blue teams 
  and red teams in our security strategy.
 However, traditional red teaming engagements are often slow, difficult to replicate or automate, 
 and consequently very costly. Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) Tools address these challenges effectively. To summarize, the key benefits of BAS Tools are:
<ul>
    <li>
        Change security approach to adapt to new threats,
    </li>
    <li>
        Improve red teams' efficency, cost, performance,
    </li>
    <li>
        Have objective results about your system security
    </li>
    <li>
        Test performance of acquired security solutions,
    </li>
    <li>
        High ROI
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Who?</h2>
As previously mentioned, the technology has been developed for red teams users and should be 
used as a purple team exercise to share the knowledge. However, the paradigm is shifting to facilitate 
the work and simplify the operations in order to make these software accessible to a trained IT team or to be
completely hosted and performed by third party companies.
